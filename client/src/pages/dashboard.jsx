        settings or location details. This streamlined design makes it perfect for 
        capturing events on the fly, ensuring you never forget a thing. While 
        currently focused on core event logging, TaskFlow is built on a flexible 
        foundation, poised for future expansion. We're actively exploring exciting 
        new features, including reminders, location integration, and more granular 
        time management, all while preserving the simplicity that makes TaskFlow 
        so enjoyable to use. Join us now and experience the power of effortless
